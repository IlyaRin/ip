## 3. **Design**

This section details the various components of the application. It will cover the internal structure of each component 
and how the components will work together with one another.

### 3.1 Component Overview

The components of the app are Main, Commons, UI, Logic, Model and Storage.

<p align="center"><img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />
<p align="center">Figure 1.Overview of components and their relationships </p>


The ***Component Overview Diagram*** above shows the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.


**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). They are responsible for:
* At app launch: Initialize the components in the correct sequence and connect them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shut down the components and invoke cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#3.2.-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.


The rest of the App consists of four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Executes commands given by the user
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

For each of the four components above:

* Defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

#### **How the components interact with one another**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `remove 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />
<p align="center"> Figure 3. Components interacting with one another

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2. Common classes

Common classes are classes used by multiple components. Common classes include:

* `Index`: Represents a zero or one based index. Using `Index` removes the need for a component to know what base other 
components are using for their index. Can be converted to an integer (int).
* `Messages`: Stores messages to be displayed to the user.
* `GuiSettings`: Contains the GUI settings.
* `LogsCenter`: Writes messages to the console and a log file. Records the state of the program as the app is running 

### 3.3 UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 4. UI component class relationship diagram </p>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.


The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts (`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`).
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)


`MainWindow.fxml` - Houses the rest of the fxml (commandBox,HelpWindow, etc) in the VBox.
Contains the code for the actual menu bar

`CommandBox.fxml` - Stackpane where the user writes input

`EntryListPanel.fxml` -  Houses a ListView<Entry>

`EntryListCard.fxml`- (not housed by Mainwindow.fxml) contains the data from each entry

`HelpWindow.fxml` - Only displays label and copy url button

`ResultDisplay.fxml` - Prints results to user 

`StatusBarFooter` - returns the path of the file retrieved


### 3.4 Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 5. Logic component class relationship diagram

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an entry).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### 3.5 Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### 3.6 Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1 Deck System

This feature would allow the user to create multiple lists of entries rather than having 
all entries together in the same list. The user could have different decks
for different languages or even multiple decks for the same languages. 

E.g. 
* Deck 1: Japanese
* Deck 2: Spanish_Food
* Deck 3: Spanish_Animals

#### Design consideration:
##### Aspect: Reason behind a deck system?

* Alternative 1 (current choice):

### Select Deck

### \[Proposed\] Flashcard System

The flashcard system would allow the user to choose to practice in whichever deck
he wishes.

The methodology behind GreenTea's flashcard system will be based on the Leitner System (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system)
The Letiner system is a proven quizzing system that increases the user's rate of learning by 
using spaced repetition. In the Leitner system, flashcards are sorted based on the user's ability to answer them. Correctly 
answered flashcards are put at the end of the question queue and incorrectly answered 
flashcards are placed at the front. 

_{Feature will be added in v1.3}_


### \[Proposed\] Data Analysis
Some of the proposed parameters tracked by GreenTea include:
* Number of correctly answered flashcards
* Previous scores
* Average time taken in total
* Time of quiz

From these data, GreenTea would be able to derive some meaningful analytics to 
display to the user. These include:
* Progression since last attempt
* Length of time between quizzes
* Most forgotten phrase/translation
* Language mastery
* Progress in each deck

_{Feature will be added in v1.3}_
